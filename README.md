Anonymous Chat is an anonymous messaging web app built using PHP and MySQL. This is an old project of mine from 2020 when i was a newbie in web dev. It also features a complete dashboard to monitor every aspect of the web app. Go ahead and try it out 😁

## How To Run
Just download the repo to your system and make sure you have XAMPP installed. The database for the project can be found in the repo in the "db" folder.
Import the database into XAMPP and place the project in htdocs, then go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser and it should work just fine 😎🔥.
